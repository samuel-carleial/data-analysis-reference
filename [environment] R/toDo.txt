PACKAGES TO ADD
https://github.com/aloy/lmeresampler
R package lmeresampler
The lme4 and nlme packages have made fitting nested linear mixed-effects models quite easy. Using the functionality of these packages we can easily use maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood to fit our model and conduct inference using our parametric toolkit. In practice, the assumptions of our model are often violated to such a degree that leads to biased estimators and incorrect standard errors. In these situations, resampling methods such as the bootstrap can be used to obtain consistent estimators of the bias and standard errors for inference. lmeresampler provides an easy way to bootstrap nested linear-mixed effects models using either the parametric, residual, cases, CGR (semi-parametric), or random effects block (REB) bootstrap fit using either lme4 or nlme. The output from lmeresampler is an lmeresamp object. Moreover, the lmeresampler package has its own print() and confint() functions, both of which follow the syntax of a generic print() and confint() function; thus, the two commands may be used with lmeresamp objects.
