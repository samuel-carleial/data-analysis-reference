maars - an R implementation of Models As Approximations
The goal of the maars package is to implement the Models As Approximations series of statistics papers (Buja, Brown, Berk, et al. 2019) and (Buja, Brown, Kuchibhotla, et al. 2019). This package was inspired by the fantastic series of lectures by Prof. Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla and Prof. Andreas Buja, as part of the “STAT 36761: Modern Linear Regression” course at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2020.
