## What is it?
(taken from original documentation)
Package, dependency and environment management for any language---Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN

Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but it can package and distribute software for any language.

Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager because conda is also an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal environment.

In its default configuration, conda can install and manage the over 7,500 packages at repo.anaconda.com that are built, reviewed, and maintained by Anaconda®.

Conda can be combined with continuous integration systems such as Travis CI and AppVeyor to provide frequent, automated testing of your code.

The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of Anaconda®, Miniconda, and Anaconda Repository. Conda is also included in Anaconda Enterprise, which provides on-site enterprise package and environment management for Python, R, Node.js, Java, and other application stacks. Conda is also available on conda-forge, a community channel. You may also get conda on PyPI, but that approach may not be as up to date.

## To use the command line
For Mac/Linux there is no conda terminal (only Windows). Be sure the .bash_profile has the correct $PATH for conda. See cheatsheet and link above for first instructions on how to kick off in conda.
