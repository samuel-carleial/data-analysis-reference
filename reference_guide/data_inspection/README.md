## Data inspection

Another important piece of every data analysis procedure is the diagnostics of variables and their relationships. Assessing summary statistics, plotting observations, and producing correlation matrices of variables can give us insights into sampling errors, data quality, and show us which sort of relationships are found among predictor variables. This step in data analysis may comprise up to 95% of the time we spend in data analysis (data collection may require almost 90-95% of the time for a whole study!). As Good & Hardy (2012) quoted in their book "Common Errors in Statistics (and How to Avoid Them)", it does not matter much the analysis and its reliability, if the data the analysis originated from is not of good quality in the first place. Therefore, it is very important to invest time in data inspection, not only to gather a better understanding of the data in question, but also to verify whether the data is of good quality and, if possible, "correct" it (ideally **post hoc** data correction is avoided, since data collection should be planed in advance to avoid any issue later on).
