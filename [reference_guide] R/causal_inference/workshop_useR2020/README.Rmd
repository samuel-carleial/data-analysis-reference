### Installing materials locally

We will be using RStudio Cloud for the workshop, but if you would like to install the required packages and course materials, we have an R package called {[useRcausal2020](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/useRcausal2020)} to help you do that! You can install {[useRcausal2020](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/useRcausal2020)} from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("malcolmbarrett/useRcausal2020")
```

Once you've installed the package, install the workshop with

``` r
useRcausal2020::install_workshop("path/to/your/computer")
```

Replace "path/to/your/computer" with where on your computer you want the workshop installed.
